# Contribution Rules
## 1. do not push to master
```text
pull request -> review -> merge
```
## 2. Complex feature
The developer who first starts to work on the feature creates this branch out of the master. 
`IF needed`
Then a separate subtask branch is created for each sub-task from the feature branch with the name and number of this subtask. 
Each subtask of that parent task will go as PR to a feature branch.

## 3. Pull request
When work on a task is finished, pull request should be opened to parent branch.

## 4. Review
At least 2 developers should review your code before merge into master
